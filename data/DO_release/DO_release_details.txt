DO Monthly release
This release includes a number of updates: (1) subsets: creation of NCIt slim (includes 4268 DOIDs);(2) creation of complex disease logical definitions; (3) DOID term count : 9,460 disease terms, with 62% of DO terms having textual definitions, this includes the addition of 833 textual definitions produced from the DO UMSOM medical students; (4) the addition of 1491 GARD rare disease xrefs and 665 MeSH xrefs identified by Wikidata users and validated by the DO team; (5) the addition of equivalent axioms populating inferred genetic disease, monogenic disease, autosomal dominant disease, cell type cancer parent to child relationships -- to date the DO contains 730 equivalent axioms and 3612 subClassOf statements. As the DO team transitions cell type cancer asserted parents to inferred parents, the DO files now 3,318 DOIDs with more than one asserted parent term. This will be resolved in the next DO build.
