New diseases include autoinflammatory syndrome, ring chromosome syndromes, and new subtypes for AML, B-ALL, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, advanced sleep phase syndrome, sideroblastic anemia, craniosynostosis, and ovarian dysgenesis. Disease classifications have been revised to fix malignant mesotheliomas and to reclassify autoinflammatory syndromes under this new term including: proteosome-associated autoinflammatory syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, familial Behcet-like autoinflammatory syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, and TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome. Additional revisions include the definitions of MASLD, MetALD, and congenital disorder of deglycosylation; added cross-references for B-ALL subtypes; and updated definition sources to replace inaccessible sources. ### Obsoleted disease(s) ID | label | term replaced by --- | --- | --- DOID:0080546 | non-alcoholic fatty liver | metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (DOID:0080208) </br> **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/compare/v2024-11-01...v2024-11-27",https://api.github.com/repos/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/releases/187871625,https://api.github.com/repos/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/releases/187871625/assets,"https://uploads.github.com/repos/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/releases/187871625/assets{?name,label}",https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/releases/tag/v2024-11-27,187871625,21225409,MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1NDA5,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21225409?v=4,NA,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron,https://github.com/allenbaron,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/followers,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/repos,https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/allenbaron/received_events,User,FALSE,RE_kwDOApA9Xc4LMrGJ,main,FALSE,FALSE,2024-11-27T17:03:44Z,https://api.github.com/repos/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/tarball/v2024-11-27,https://api.github.com/repos/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/zipball/v2024-11-27,NA
